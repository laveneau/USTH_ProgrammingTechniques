# USTH_ProgrammingTechniques
Programming Techniques course at USTH, week 2

This project contains three folders:
- The `Lectures` folders.
- The `Labworks` one. 
- And the `Project`.

## Lectures
There is 4 lectures into 4 subfolders. 
Read them carefully before to start the associated labworks.
Each lecture is made as a Jupyter file.

A very simple way to run a Jupyter file is to use [Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (from Microsoft but it works everywhere). 
You will need the `Jupyter` extension and the `Python` extension for running that...

## Labworks
After finishing to read one lecture, you should do the corresponding labwork. 
After, means that you must read the lecture first! 

Labworks are made as Jupyter files too. 
By running the cells (control-enter) you will write some files into the `.dummy` subdirectory. 
You may then continue to work from the Jupyter file, OR directly into the `.dummy` folder.

## Project
When you have finished coding all the labworks (and so reading all the lectures!), you have to do the project.
The project will lead to a mark that count for this teaching unit. 
Read carefully the instruction!
